Large data set example
======================

In the next example a synthetic data set is introduced, where a Wenner
array is combined with a pole-dipole array and covers an 8-km long
profile. The synthetic model is a 1000 Ohm- m half space covered by a
50-m thick overburden of variable electrical resistivity (200 Ohm-m
section on the left, followed by 50 Ohm-m section in the middle,
followed by 500 Ohm-m section on the right. The background resistive
media is hosting two rectangular bodies at 150-m depth each. The prism
on the left side is resistive (10,000 Ohm-m resistivity) and the prism
on the right side is conductive (50 Ohm-m) (Figure :numref:`synLarge` a).

For the Wenner array the following configuration was used: number of
stations = 400; minimum a-spacing = 80 m; maximum a-spacing 1367 m
(spreading coefficient: 1.5 to accommodate up to 8 spreads per station).
The spreading coefficient in this case is the multiplier used to
calculate the increased spread distance between the potential electrodes
for each station, given the minimum separation ) The total number of
data for Wenner array (considering number of stations and all possible
separations) was 2610 (Figure :numref:`synLarge` b).

The pole-dipole synthetic survey used a=75 m and n=1,10. The current
pole was fixed on the right hand side of the array. This resulted in a
total number of pole-dipole data of 1005 (Figure :numref:`synLarge` c). The
combined Wenner and pole-dipole data set contains 3615 data (Figure
:numref:`synLarge` d).

This synthetic model was discretized with a mesh, composed of 17918
cells (including padding), with the smallest cells reaching 30 m
horizontally and 15 m vertically for the core region (depth to 1 km).

   (a) The true model create for a large-scale synthetic data set by
   combining Wenner and Pole-dipole configurations. (b) The synthetic
   data from the Wenner array and (c) pole-dipole array are combined to
   get the (d) synthetic data for the entire data set.

This synthetic data set was contaminated with 5% Gaussian noise and
inverted using :math:`l_1` measure for model objective function in order
to accommodate a more blocky inversion result. The inversion control
file is provided below:

The inversion converged in 17 iterations (Figure :numref:`synLargeRes` a) and
was able to reconstruct all of the features shallower than 500-m of
depth. This is consistent with the depth of investigation for this
survey, based on the sensitivity (Figure :numref:`synLargeRes` b).

   (a) The true model create for a large-scale synthetic data set by
   combining Wenner and Pole-dipole configurations. (b) The recovered
   model from inversion of the large synthetic data set with the Ekblom
   norm showing the DOI based on sensitivity analysis (threshold = 0.4).
   (c) The convergence curves show how the inversion performed.

The observed data were compared with the predicted data. The misfit is
shown in Figure :numref:`synLargeMisfit`. The predicted data error does not
exceed 3.9 standard deviations and overall data misfit is 3597.6.

   (a) Observed apparent resistivity (mixed Wenner/Pole-dipole data set)
   and the (b) data misfit, which is normalized by the standard
   deviation.

Finally, the parallelization of Â with OpenMP was analyzed on this
example. It was inverted twice using 1 and 12 threads (6 cores with
hyper-threading capability) with identical results. Running this example
on one thread took 1:15:50.68 of CPU time, while running it on 6 cores
(12 threads) resulted in convergence in 0:25:16.86 of CPU time, which is
almost a threefold increase in productivity since the last release.
