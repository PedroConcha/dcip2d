Elements of the program DCIP2D
==============================

Introduction
------------

The program library consists of the programs:

#. : performs forward modelling for DC and IP data

#. : inverts DC potentials to recover a conductivity model

#. : inverts IP data to recover a chargeability model

Each of the above programs requires input files as well as the
specification of parameters in order to run. However, some files are
used by a number of programs. Before detailing the run procedures for
each of the above programs we first present information about these
general files.

General files for Â programs
---------------------------

There are six general files which are used in . These are:

#. : specifies the observed measurements and the associated electrode
   locations

#. : contains the electrode locations for forward modelling

#. : contains the finite difference mesh for the 2D modelling and
   inversions

#. : contains the topographic data

#. : structure to hold cell values for models: conductivity,
   chargeability or active

#. : file that contains special weightings which alter the type of model
   produced in the inversions

#. : a special type of model file specifying the active cells
