\subsubsection{Observations file}

This file contains the observed measurements and the associated electrode locations. Both potential data and apparent chargeability data are stored in the same format. This will be the format of all the data files that are output from \codeName{DCIPF2D}, and are input to \codeName{DCINV2D} and \codeName{IPINV2D}.

It is assumed that the survey is carried out either along a line in the $x-$direction perpendicular to geologic strike or along a borehole. In the presence of topography, it is assumed that all current and potential electrodes are located along the line and are placed on the topography at each $x$ location. In other words, the programs in the \prog~package will automatically place the electrodes on the surface according to the topography and the $x$ location given in the observations file. Electrodes will be at $z=0$ if topography is not given (e.g., set to null). The $z$ coordinates should be provided in the observations file when the data are located down a borehole. Any surface/borehole combination of electrodes is allowed in \programName. The observations file can have three different formats: the \codeName{general}, \codeName{surface}, or \codeName{simple} format. Only a single format is allowed in a data file. \textbf{The general format is the only format that will allow the use of borehole locations}. The type of format chosen to store the data does not make any difference to the \prog~program library and is determined only by the user's preference. At the beginning of execution, the programs will determine the format and the output files will be written in the same format. Standard deviations are optional in each format. The calculation of the standard deviation within \codeName{DCIP2D} is given below in the detailed summaries of components. All standard deviations must either be given or not given to be calculated. 

\paragraph{Calculation of default standard deviations} The default standard deviation is calculated from the DC data using the following rules: stn$_i = 0.05 \times |\phi_i| + \phi_{max}$, where $\phi_{max}$ is the potential at the maximum electrode separation averaged over five (5) adjacent stations. The default standard deviation is calculated for IP data by: stn$_i = 0.05 \times |\eta_i| + \eta_{min}$, where $\eta_{min}$ is calculated standard deviation of all apparent chargeabilities in the data set. We stress that the default errors are only an initial guess and they facilitate a preliminary inversion of the data. The user will want to alter these error estimates for the final inversion used for interpretation. The data with the default errors are written in \fileName{dcinv2d.log} using the given format. They can be copied to a file for finer adjustment of the error estimates or the user can supply his or her own errors directly. 

\subsubsection*{General format}
The \prog~library can handle arbitrary electrode configurations, and a mixture of different configurations can be present in the data file. This is accomplished by specifying the locations of four electrodes for each datum. Whenever the two current electrodes, or two potential electrodes, are given the identical location, that particular pair is considered to be a single pole with the negative electrode being at infinity. The format consists of a line with the current electrode location and number of potential electrode locations associated with it. Each location has $x$ and $z$ coordinates. An example of the \fileName{general} format file structure is as follows:

\paragraph{Example of general format} 

The following is an example of DC data (e.g., no IPTYPE):

\begin{fileExample}
\begin{tabular}{|cccccc|}

\end{tabular}
\end{fileExample}
%
In the above example, there are two current electrode locations, the first with six potential electrodes and the second with two potential electrode data. The line ``IPTYPE=2'' would be added if this file were IP data of second potentials. 

\subsubsection*{Surface format}
The surface format is similar to the general format with difference that the elevation data is not given. Instead, the program places the electrodes on top of the discretized topographic surface. Accordingly, this format \textbf{cannot be used with borehole data} and if no topography is given, assumes the data are on top of the mesh at an elevation of 0. Whenever the two current electrodes, or two potential electrodes, are given the identical location, that particular pair is considered to be a single pole with the negative electrode being at infinity. The format consists of a line with the current electrode location and number of potential electrode locations associated with it. An example of the \fileName{surface} format file structure is as follows:

\begin{fileExample}
\begin{tabular}{|cccc|}

The following is an example of IP data in units of apparent chargeability:

In the above example, there are two current electrode locations, the first with four potential electrodes and the second with two potential electrode data. The line ``IPTYPE=1'' would be absent if this file were DC data. 

\subsubsection*{Simple format}
The simple format is the most straightforward, but also most restrictive of the three formats. The elevations are not given similar to the surface format with difference that the elevation data is not given. Instead, the program places the electrodes on top of the discretized topographic surface. Accordingly, this format \textbf{cannot be used with borehole data} and if no topography is given, assumes the data are on top of the mesh at an elevation of 0. Whenever the two current electrodes, or two potential electrodes, are given the identical location, that particular pair is considered to be a single pole with the negative electrode being at infinity. The format consists of a line with the current electrode pair location and potential electrode location pair. An example of the \fileName{surface} format file structure is as follows:

\begin{fileExample}
\begin{tabular}{|cccccc|}
\hline
\multicolumn{6}{|l|}{! Comment line} \\
\multicolumn{6}{|l|}{[IPTYPE= 1 | 2]} \\
$A_1^x$ & $B_1^x$ &  $M_1^x$ & $N_1^x$ & $ val_1$ & $[stn_1]$ \\
$A_2^x$ & $B_2^x$ &  $M_2^x$ & $N_2^x$ & $ val_2$ & $[stn_2]$\\
$\vdots$ & $\vdots$ & $\vdots$ & $\vdots$ & $\vdots$ & $\vdots$\\
